## Overview

The Ocient Datasource plugin allows Grafana to connect to [Ocient](https://ocient.com/) databases, enabling you to visualize and analyze your data stored in Ocient directly from Grafana dashboards. This plugin provides both a SQL editor for custom queries and a visual query builder to help you create queries without writing SQL.

This plugin is not officially supported by Ocient.

Key features:
- SQL query editor for custom SQL queries
- Visual query builder interface
- Schema and table browser
- WHERE clause builder with distinct value selection
- Time range integration for time series data
- Secure connections with TLS support
